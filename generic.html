									<h1>About Me</h1>
									<p>Still find me boring? Well... it proabably won't change after reading more about me either<br />
									but stick around, we might have something in common.</p>
								</header>
								<div class="image main"><img src="images/about_me.jpg" alt="Picture of me" style="max-width: 80%; height: auto; margin: 0 auto;"/></div>
								<p>If you did not know already, my name is Mikael. I am 21 years old and currently in my final year of studying to become a Customer Data Developer.
									As a Customer Data Developer, I play a pivotal role in
									bridging the gap between the marketing team and the
									technical team, ensuring seamless communication
									and collaboration for the effective utilization of
									customer data. My primary responsibility is to facilitate
									the extraction, transformation, and loading (ETL) of
									data from various sources into accessible formats that
									empower both teams to make informed decisions.
									A noteworthy fact is that my classmates and I will be 
									among the first individuals to graduate from this role, 
									as it's a newly introduced position on the job market.
									</p>
								<p>In my spare time I enjoy being active, living a healthy lifestyle 
									and learning new things - wether that is about myself or the things 
									this world has to offer. My favorite sports to play and watch 
									are basketball and martial arts. When it comes to my music taste it changes weekly.
									Another hobby I have is my podcast that I startet back in 2022 with a close friend.
									Running a podcast not only brings me joy but also provides a platform to share my thoughts, 
									insights, and advice with others.
									Since starting school again, I have discovered a newfound interest in the potential of data.
									Data is one of life's most crucial tools, and we accumulate it daily, whether it's in our phones, journals, 
									or our minds. Since I like having structure in my life, I find pleasure in 
									cleaning and organizing data, but also making it alive by visializing it. The data point is only
									one of many newfound interests I have found since starting my data developer journey but if you have
									read this far you can now see why I enjoy what I do.<br>
									- Mikael
